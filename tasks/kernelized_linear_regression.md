Starting with the [kernelized_linear_regression.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl129/tree/master/labs/05/kernelized_linear_regression.py),
implement kernelized linear regression training using SGD
on the dual formulation. You should support _polynomial_
and _Gaussian_ kernels and also L2 regularization. More details
are present in the template.
